It turns out that these two measures are almost equivalent: if each observation has been centered to have mean zero and standard deviation one, and if we let $r_{ij}$ denote the correlation between the ith and jth observations, then the quantity $1-r_{ij}$ is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance between the ith and jth observations. On the `USArrests` data, show that this proportionality holds.\n",

    "Dynamic Time warping is a way to calculate distances between datapoints when the datapoints are shifted horizontally in time between each other, but the shape is consistent.  Unlike Euclidean distance, for DTW, the two time series do not have to have an equal length. DTW calculates the smallest distance between all points and then finds the closest matching points.  Here is an illustration of how it works. (https://rpubs.com/esobolewska/dtw-time-series)"
